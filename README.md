# Text-Summarization

Text summarization is a beautiful cognitive task in which humans go through a piece of context and somehow magically come up with a gist of it.

Let's take an example such as the one below:

Text: Psychologist Dr. Jessica Zucker, author of "I Had a Miscarriage: A Memoir, A Movement," tells TODAY.com that people generally refer to a baby born after a pregnancy loss, infant death, stillbirth or miscarriage as a rainbow baby.

My Summary: A rainbow baby is a baby born after some kind of loss such as a miscarriage.

It is evident that different people will come up with different summaries according to their own perspectives. I have always wondered about how to automatically construct a summary of a given text. There were some very good logical attempts of extractive and absractive summarizations such as using frequency counts, lex rank, text rank, LSA, ESA, Lexical Chains, etc. However, in the current LLM era, deep learning models are achieving close to impeccable results in the text summarization task!

Why not create a text summarization module using LLMs and experience its summarization skills? I am going to closely follow the below tutorial to build my summarization model.
