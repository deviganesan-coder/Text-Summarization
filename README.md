# Text-Summarization

Text summarization is a beautiful cognitive task in which humans go through a piece of context and somehow magically come up with its gist. There are some very good logical attempts of extractive and absractive summarizations such as using frequency counts, lex rank, text rank, LSA, ESA, Lexical Chains, etc. However, in the current LLM era, deep learning models are achieving close to impeccable results in the text summarization task!

Why not create a text summarization module using LLMs and experience its summarization skills? Please refer to the jupyter notebook for more details.
